## Welcome to ML PROJECT - LINEAR REGRESSION

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/asrujana/ML-linearModel/edit/asrujana-patch-1/docs/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/asrujana/ML-linearModel/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
